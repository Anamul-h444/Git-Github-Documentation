Pull:
Pull means update local repository from remote repository.
When working as a team on a project, it is important that everyone stays up to date.

Any time you start working on a project, you should get the most recent changes to your local copy.

With Git, you can do that with pull.
	-> git pull origin

Clone:
Clone means copy of a repository from remote to local.
A clone is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files.

Move back to the original repository, and click the green "Code" button to get the URL to clone:
	-> git clone https://github.com/Anamul-h444/testGit.git
