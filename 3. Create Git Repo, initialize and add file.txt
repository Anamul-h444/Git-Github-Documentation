Creating git repository and adding new files:

Creating a git folder or directory:
	-> mkdir folderName
	-> cd folderName
	-> git init

Initialize git:
	-> git init (for initialization)
You just created your first Git Repository!
Note: Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated it on.
Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.

Adding new file in directory:
You just created your first local Git repo. But it is empty.
So let's add some files, or create a new file
	-> touch fileName.extension (for create file)
	-> open fileName.extension (for open file)
	-> ls (for check file list)

Example:
touch index.html

Check status:
	-> git status

After check status showing below result:
On branch master
No commits yet
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        index.html
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:
	• Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
	• Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository
 When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.
