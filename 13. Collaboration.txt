I am owner.
I want to add worker in my project.
Open repository which I want to add worker.
Settings -> collaborates -> Add People

Worker get a message in his mail and receive. Now he access as owner because from owner
there is no rules.

Set Rules from owner:
Settings -> branches -> Add Rule -> Branch name as Master because master is main repo, so other
branches is access -> Check Require a pull request berore marging etc.

Now worker completed work he create a sub branch and push.
Then send pull request.
If owner satisfy he approved otherwise he change request with write error in messtage.
