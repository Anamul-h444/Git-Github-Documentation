Git undo theory:
	-> git log --oneline (For Check commit shortly)
	-> git show (For check what is changed in commit)
	-> git show commit-id (For check what is changed in commit by commit id)
	-> git checkout commit-id (For go any commit by commit id)
	-> git checkout master (For go Master branch)

Note: by checkout go commit only for check what is happend by no work. Again when come last head type git checkout master.
If git log then go back terminal by type ->q
